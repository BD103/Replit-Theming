<!-- TODO: Check over so that it makes sense... -->

This guide was originally inspired by [Reflux](https://pypi.org/project/reflux/), a project by [Frissyn / IreTheKid](https://github.com/frissyn). Their [original API](https://pypi.org/project/reflux/0.2.0/) was difficult to use and quite tedious.

Thankfully, the project is getting a [much needed rewrite](https://github.com/frissyn/Reflux/pull/6). While we wait for that to happen, I pulled together an alternate implementation. It instead uses Sass.

> Sass is an extension language to CSS. It adds many features, including variables, inheritence, functions, and more. It is a very popular language for writing stylesheets.

> You can find their website [here](https://sass-lang.com/)!

To get started, clone [this repo here](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme). You can also [click this link](https://replit.com/github/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme) to easily open up a new and ready-to-use repl.

## Project Structure

There are a few key files in this project. The first is [package.json](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme/blob/main/package.json). It uses NPM to download the latest version of Sass.

The second is [src/initial.scss](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme/blob/main/src/initial.scss). It should look something like the following:

```scss
// $variable-name: value

$background: #2e3440;
$foreground: #eceff4;
$outline: #434c5e;

$primary: #88c0d0;
$positive: #a3be8c;
$negative: #bf616a;
```

This file shows some base values. What you are going to be doing is changing the values of each to a different color.

Next is [src/theme.scss](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme/blob/main/src/theme.scss), which contains the selectors for when your theme should be activated.

```scss
@use "mixins";

// ...

.dark {
  @include mixins.replit-theme;
}
```

This file is what is actually built. What you can do is create a new selector, then add the `@include mixins.replit-theme` line. Here is an excert of the [src/mixins.scss](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme/blob/main/src/mixins.scss) file.

```scss
// This mixin applies the following rules
@mixin replit-theme {
    // & means the parent selector, so the
    // following means .dark.replit-ui-theme-root
    &.replit-ui-theme-root {
        // Variables go here
    }
}
```

> [Mixins](https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6) are a special objects that can inject their own styling into whatever object uses the `@include <name>` statement. You can see the documentation [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin).
>
> ```scss
> @mixin my-mixin {
>   color: red;
> }
> 
> body {
>   background-color: white;
>   @include my-mixin;
> }
> ```
>
> Turns into:
>
> ```css
> body {
>   background-color: white;
>   color: red;
> }
> ```

For creating these themes, you don't just have to do the theme for light mode or dark mode. You could also do the following:

```scss
.light { @include mixins.replit-theme; }
.dark { @include mixins.replit-theme; }
.spooky { @include mixins.replit-theme; }
```

This would make the theme apply to everything. (This may not affect the code editor, though!)

## Editing

To edit, make sure the selector in [src/theme.scss](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme/blob/main/src/theme.scss) is what you want. Then all you should have to do is edit [src/initial.scss](https://github.com/BD103/Custom-Replit-Theme/blob/main/src/initial.scss). That's it!

Some things to keep in mind:

- Background and foreground should be opposites in lightness
    - If the background is dark, the foreground should be light. If the background is light, the foreground should be dark.
- Try to mimic the colors. If it is green, try replacing it with another shade of green. The Replit developers made it that way for a reason.
- **Test your designs!** Make sure it works, which brings us to our next section.

## Testing

To test your edits, install all the dependencies with:

```shell
npm install
```

You only need to do this once. Now build with the run button or `npm run build`. Check for theme.css in the dist folder. Paste this file into [the CSS Inject website](https://mcdlr.com/css-inject/), click "Generate Bookmarklet", and drag the link "Nome" into your bookmarks bar. Open up a Replit page (preferably the editor) and click "Nome". It should change colors.

> This part is probably where you will find issues. Javascript is notorious for not telling you what goes wrong, so testing is debugging is extremely difficult.

> If you cannot figure out what is going on, [leave an issue on the repository](https://github.com/BD103/Replit-Theming/issues) and I'll help you get it fixed.
