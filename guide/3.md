<!-- TODO: Check over so that it makes sense... -->

This guide was originally inspired by [Reflux](https://pypi.org/project/reflux/), a project by [Frissyn / IreTheKid](https://github.com/frissyn). Their [original API](https://pypi.org/project/reflux/0.2.0/) was difficult to use and quite tedious.

Thankfully, the project is getting a [much needed rewrite](https://github.com/frissyn/Reflux/pull/6). While we wait for that to happen, I pulled together an alternate implementation. It instead uses Sass.

> Sass is an extension language to CSS. It adds many features, including variables, inheritence, functions, and more. It is a very popular language for writing stylesheets.

> You can find their website [here](https://sass-lang.com/)!
