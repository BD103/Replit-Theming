There is no great way of injecting CSS. There are probably some browser extensions, but a common approach are bookmarklets.

> Bookmarklets are Javascript snippets that you can run on any page. They are commonly pinned to the bookmarks bar and are formatted as a generic function that is URL-safe. I wrote a [blog post](https://bd103.github.io/2021/09/27/bookmarklets.html) on them.

So now that we know we want to use bookmarklets, we have another problem.

## How do we inject the CSS???

There are so many ways, one of the easiest is to adjust the CSS of every single element.

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div id="container">
    ...
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div id="container" style="color: red;">
    ...
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("container").style.color = "red";
```

Another is inserting a `<link>` tag that goes to a hosted stylesheet.

```js
var myTag = document.createElement("link");
myTag.rel = "stylesheet";
myTag.href = "https://linkto.site";
document.head.appendChild(myTag);
```

The last that I can think of is creating a custom `<style>` tag.

```js
var myTag = document.createElement("style");
var myTagContent = document.createTextNode("body{color:red;}");
myTag.appendChild(myTagContent);
document.head.appendChild(myTag);
```

## Our Solution

All of those are good, but in reality **we don't need to worry about that**. In my journey through bookmarklets, I have found a [really wonderful website](https://mcdlr.com/css-inject/) that allows your to create these scripts from a stylesheet. *No effort is required on our part!*

To create the bookmarklet, paste in your new stylesheet to the website, click "Generate Bookmarklet" and drag the link to your bookmarks bar.
